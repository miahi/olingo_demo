        <p>
            The InforMEA toolkit project aims at facilitating the MEAs (Conventions) to expose their data to the outside world 
            as a web service.
        </p>
        <p>
            An web service allows other interested parties on access and retrieval of the data via electronic means, by allowing
            computer-to-computer communication.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            On top of this, the toolkit also offers the data structure in a way which is the same across all Conventions. This
            was achieved by establishing a common structure for each of the entities that are shared (National Focal Points,
            Meetings, Decisions etc.)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The protocol used to expose the information is called <a href="http://www.odata.org">OData</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The toolkit is part of the InforMEA project, developed by UNEP and supported by the member conventions.
